\title{ Function to score the response files }
\description{
  This function can score the dichotomous item responses. 
  The function can also call and return results from function reliability.
}
\usage{
score(items, key = NA, output.scored = F, ID = NA, rel = F)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{items}{ The item response }
  \item{key}{ The answer key }
  \item{output.scored}{ If output.scored=F (the default) only a vector of scores is returned. 
                        If output.scored=T a matrix containing scored items is returned.  }
  \item{ID}{ If respondent IDs are provided scores are labeled appropriately.}
  \item{rel}{ If rel=T, the function will call the function reliability and provide that output as well. }
